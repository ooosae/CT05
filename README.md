## Preamble

If your goal is not only to get an internship, but also to establish yourself for future employment with the company, then it is important for you to immerse yourself in the corporate culture and learn what the rules and regulations are. During the internship it is important to "get on the inside", to become a real part of an organization, which means not only to show results, but also to play by the company's rules.

In this project, we will understand how to recognize these rules and what they include. We'll also address the topic of information cybersecurity. You, as an employee of the company will have access to the data and it is your responsibility to protect the company from information leaks and cyber-attacks.

First, let's turn to the terminology:

**Corporate culture** is a set of norms, traditions and values that are accepted by the members of an organization and ensure the creation of a strong competitive team united by common goals and motivations. The company's rules will help you adapt.

**Information security** is the comprehensive protection of information and its supporting infrastructure from any accidental or malicious influences that could result in damage to the information itself, its owners, or its supporting infrastructure. The objectives of information security are to minimize damage and to predict and prevent such impacts.

**Cybersecurity** is a set of methods and practices to protect computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks and data from attackers. Cybersecurity has applications in a wide range of areas, from business to mobile technology. Several main categories can be distinguished in this direction.

## Chapter II
## General rules

1. All along the way, you'll be accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: it's perfectly normal. Don't forget that the information in the repository and Google is always with you, as are the peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense and don't be afraid of mistakes.
2. Be mindful of the sources of information: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, reread it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a task condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like that, try to figure it out. If it doesn't work, put the question in the list of open questions, and you'll find the answer as you go along. Don't leave open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible to complete, remember that it's not true: you only see it this way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter different tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are suitable for the most meticulous and inquisitive students. These assignments are of higher difficulty and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system and those around you. After all, you're fooling yourself first and foremost.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you resort to someone else's help, make sure you always understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't do you any good.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch will be ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those designated in the assignments.

## Chapter III
## Corporate Culture / Corporate Etiquette

Why research a company's corporate culture, understand the rules and play by them? Doesn't that limit your freedom to be yourself?
 Following the rules of corporate culture doesn't mean you stop being yourself, it means making your job easier and simpler. When you go skiing, you usually go along the ski track, not perpendicular to it.

Another definition of corporate culture goes like this: Corporate culture consists of sustainable patterns of behavior that have developed in a company and have proven effective in different situations, from extreme to mundane. The main elements of corporate culture are rituals, overt and unspoken rules, office interaction rules, management model, and human communication. It's like an environment where all employees and processes exist. It is highly visible to anyone who does business with the company: from clients to partners and candidates. In simple terms, corporate culture is designed to make the lives of employees and achievement of goals as easy as possible. Often the rules of corporate culture directly correlate with the laws of basic politeness and etiquette.

Before you go any further, I recommend three books to read:

1. ["New Rules of Business Correspondence," by M. Ilyakhov](materials/Деловая_переписка.pdf)
2. ["Rules of Business Communication. 33 dos and don'ts" by N. Zvereva](materials/Правила_делового_общения.pdf)
3. [О. Sheveleva's "Manners for a Career"](materials/Манеры_для_карьеры.pdf)

Let's break down how to dive in and explore each element of corporate culture.

You can immerse yourself in the rules of corporate culture by studying information about the company, as well as getting to know its employees. You can listen to the speeches of the company's top managers: they often mention what exactly constitutes the company's values and what kind of corporate culture the company has. You can look at the company's website: sometimes there is a separate section dedicated to corporate culture. Also, you can talk to the employees of the company, for example, you can ask your HR about the main principles of the company's corporate culture.

### Appearance

_Coco Chanel once said: "You will not have a second chance to make a first impression"._

What is important in an employee's appearance?
 Shoes, clothes, well-groomed skin, nails, hair.

Also, it's important to match your appearance to the company you find yourself in.

Watch the movie "The Intern," pay attention to what the firm's employees are wearing and the way the main character is dressed. Appearance tells a lot more about you than you'd like to think. An unkempt appearance may suggest that you don't really value yourself or your work. Can people trust you then? This is not only important for offline meetings, but also for online ones. Among other things, you demonstrate self-respect through your appearance. If you respect yourself, the supervisor and coworkers will, in their turn, respect your hard work and contributions.

### Working hours

Time is one of the most important resources. We should value our work hours, project deadlines, vacations, and so on. All of these concepts are your working tools. Working hours are an important condition of employment, so clarify the company's working hours at the interview stage.

First, you'll have to learn the company's customs:

- What time does the work day start and end?
- Do employees often work overtime and stay late? Is overtime and work on weekends paid?
- How to approach the topic of vacation? With whom should the dates be coordinated?

### Workspace - toilet/coffee/dining area

At work, we don't just work.

Every human being has certain physiological needs. At work, we also eat, go to the bathroom, someone smokes, etc. There are breaks from work, and they too can be spent somehow: you can take a walk or spend time in the recreation area. You can ask all these questions to the HR manager who will support your employment. In addition, all of these questions can be an opportunity to get to know and communicate with your colleagues.
 Learn from your colleagues:

- where the restroom is;
- where you can drink some coffee, whether it is customary in the company for employees to bring their own coffee and something for it, whether the company buys tea/coffee and sweets/buns, etc.
- where the cafeteria is;
- where the recreation area/gym is located, if any;

Your workplace:

- where your workspace will be;
- how to make a pass;
- where to get the equipment;
- how to formalize access to the systems;
- how to formalize remote access if you'll work in hybrid/remote mode.

Find out if the company has open areas where you can work, such as a coffee shop.

## Rules of communication

The next big block is dedicated to communication. You don't work alone, you work in a team, and it is very important to establish communication in such a way that colleagues would want to talk to you and help you. We recommend you to go through these books:

1. ["New Rules of Business Correspondence," by M. Ilyakhov](materials/Деловая_переписка.pdf)
2. ["Rules of Business Communication. 33 dos and don'ts" by N. Zvereva](materials/Правила_делового_общения.pdf)
3. [О. Sheveleva's "Manners for a Career"](materials/Манеры_для_карьеры.pdf)

**Conversations**
No matter who you are talking to, you will first need to get to know that person. Do not hesitate to ask your colleague's name again and ask him/her a few casual questions: how long has he/she been with the company, what does he/she do etc. Don't forget to introduce yourself, tell people who you are and what task you plan to work on. It's important to say hello if you haven't seen the person that day and goodbye if the day is winding down.
 Address people by their names.

**Corporate email**
Learn what electronic communication tools, such as email clients/services and calendars employees use.

**Messengers**
Find out what messengers your colleagues use. Ask whether you can install a desktop version of the messenger on your laptop or computer or not.

**Calendar - meetings /vacations**
 Find out what application the meetings are posted in. Figure out how to accept or decline a meeting and how to write back. Figure out which meetings are offline and which are online.

**Offline Meetings**
 Determine where exactly the meeting will be held. Check with coworkers in advance to find out exactly where this meeting room is. Show up early for a meeting: being late also gives the impression of you as an uncommitted person.

**Online Meetings**
 Make sure you have installed the right software to connect to an online meeting, and whether your camera and microphone are working. It's important to have meetings with your camera on, especially at the beginning of your job/internship. It's important for coworkers to get to know and remember you.

**Vacation/breaks**
You haven't even started working yet, and we're already talking about your vacation. Vacation is an important part of work, and it is true that it is worth thinking about in advance. You are part of the operating system. You are doing your part of the job. Colleagues count on you. Therefore, warn in advance that you plan to go on vacation, even if you have an unpaid internship, let alone a job. Notify your colleagues in advance and set an auto-reply in your email for the duration of your vacation. If you don't know how to do it, google it or ask your colleagues for help. Do not make a mistake when an incorrectly set auto-reply leads to sending emails from your name throughout the company.

## Safety culture

Security is something that must not be violated!
 The loss of any company data or the penetration of cyber threats into corporate systems can lead to criminal liability. Forewarned is forearmed! We're not talking about intentional leaks right now. First of all, it's important to prevent accidental leaks.

**The simplest things:** sending information via messenger, using a flash drive, or opening an external website from a work computer can result in data loss or make the system prone to a cyberattack. Please don't let your guard down.

An accidental leak, despite the lack of goals and prepared actions, can cause tangible damage to a company. It can compromise an organization's reputation, reveal trade secrets, or provide important information to competitors. The main danger is that an incident is usually discovered after a period of time, which prevents remedial action and damage minimization.

Unintentional leakage is a situation in which information is unintentionally disclosed to a person or people not originally authorized to possess it. It occurs most often during monotonous work, when, due to fatigue or negligence of the employee, information gets or is transmitted to third parties through an unprotected communication channel or using removable drives. In all such cases, there is a violation of security policies.

Typical examples illustrating unintentional information leakage include:

- Entering the wrong email address while sending/forwarding emails;
- Sending data via messenger or social media to the wrong recipient;
- Use of open file sharing, cloud services, open access documents to store sensitive data;
- An unattended computer left on with sensitive data;
- Use of removable storage media and subsequent loss or transfer of data to a home computer.

**The main channels of accidental leakage:**

1. Mobile devices.
 Today, we store most of our personal data on a smartphone or a phone. Personal data such as full name, photo, bank card can be linked to the device. In addition, there may be passwords and logins for websites, social networks, online stores, and files which a person uses during the work process. The loss or theft of a mobile device can cost the owner dearly.

2. E-mail, messengers.
 Lack of attention and excessive workload can lead to sending documents to the wrong recipient. There is also a possibility of being redirected through a phishing link or installing malware, which can lead to data leaks.

3. File sharing services.
 Many large companies use various cloud services for convenience, which allow you to get quick access to information and store large amounts of data. Incorrect configuration of file access rights, server error, transfer of links over an insecure channel contribute to uncontrolled access of third parties to this data.

## Chapter IV
## Exercise 00
### Before starting an internship/job

You have already selected several vacancies in Project01 that match your values and priorities. Now you need to learn more about the company and prepare for the internship.

1. Explore 3 sources for gaining insights into a company's corporate culture and answer a few questions:

- How are employees dressed? Is there a dress code?
- What to wear on the first day to fit the company culture?
- How do you know what time to come to the internship and what time you can leave?
- What else is important for you to know about the workplace and working hours? Write 5 points.

2. Make a list of questions that you couldn't find answers to and will ask on the first working day.

## Exercise 01
### Your first day

Now imagine it's your first day on the job at the company. You need to compose a business card letter to present yourself to the team.

1. Write a letter to your coworkers and introduce yourself. Think through the structure of the letter: who you are, what your name is, and what task you'll be working on. Think about what facts will be useful to colleagues. At the end it's great to add the phrase "I look forward to being of service to the company and to you".
2. Many companies ask you to attach a photo. Think through and attach a photo that best represents you to the team.
